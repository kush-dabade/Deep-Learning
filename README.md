This repository is a collection of my projects, notebooks, and experiments while learning **Deep Learning** through the Udemy course *Deep Learning A-Z™: Hands-On Artificial Neural Networks*.  
It documents my journey into neural networks, from the basics of ANNs to more advanced architectures like CNNs, with an emphasis on **building intuition and hands-on practice**.

---

## 🚀 What You'll Find Here
- **Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs)** — fundamentals, architecture, backpropagation, and practical projects.
- **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** — convolution, pooling, flattening, fully connected layers, and image classification.
- **Projects & Case Studies**:
  - Customer Churn Prediction (ANN)
  - Image Recognition (Cats vs. Dogs using CNNs)
- **Model Evaluation & Tuning** — training, testing, validation, hyperparameter tuning, avoiding overfitting.
- **Hands-On Notebooks** — Python implementations using TensorFlow, Keras, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib.
